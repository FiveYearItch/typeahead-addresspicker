Demo available here: http://sgruhier.github.io/typeahead-addresspicker/

Quick example to show how to use twitter typeahead autocomplete and google map API to make an address picker.

This example is just a first try and could be enhanced to fully replace my previous address picker: http://xilinus.com/jquery-addresspicker/demos/
